"""Search Names Pipeline - Organized workflow for name processing.

This module provides a systematic 4-step pipeline for processing names:

Step 1: Clean - Parse and standardize raw names
Step 2: Augment - Add supplementary data (nicknames, prefixes)
Step 3: Preprocess - Optimize search patterns and deduplicate
Step 4: Search - Execute high-performance name search

Each step builds on the previous one, creating a complete name processing workflow.
